== Installation Instructions ==========
Applications used for the Pandas_Challenge:
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitBash terminal
- Visual Studio Code for the Readme.md
- Git Hub (to save versions and share code while in development)

Similar applications may also work.


== Operating Instructions =============
Open pymaceuticals_analysis file in Jupyter Notebook.
Review Analysis at the top of the notebook.
Play/run all rows in order from top to bottom to review code output.


== List of Files ====================
\pymaceuticals
    \.ipynb_checkpoints
    \data
        Mouse_metadata.csv
        Study_results.csv
    pymaceuticals_analysis.ipynb (data analysis & code notebook)
    pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb (starter file with instructions)
    README.md


== Data Set =======================
Two .csv data files were provided as part of this project.
See \Resources folder above or in pymaceuticals directory.


== Data Alterations =======================
List any data removed from dataset and not used for analysis. List why and possible impact to analysis (if any).



== Known Bugs =====================
None.


== Troubleshooting ===============
#print hashtags are used liberally throughout the code to run individual lines of code for additional testing/troubleshooting, and general comment hashtags for code notes/additional information.

Resources used to build and troubleshoot this code are listed below, in addition to help and code peer review from students, instructor, and TA's in class and external tutor (N.Tsai). 
Additional Git Hub Resources: S. Saha, J. Fan, ZG. Scherrer, E. Gaga, M. Carty.
